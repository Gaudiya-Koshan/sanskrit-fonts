# sanskrit-fonts
This is a repository of Unicode compliant fonts that contain the sanskrit diacritic or Devanagari character sets.

As fonts are recommended:

- If licensed for more than private use, they'll be included directly in the 'fonts' folder 
- If not licensed, will be linked into a web page that will soon be viewable at a link posted just here.

I'll work on this in the next couple of days. - Ekendra (23 May 2023)
